Approximate History
--------------------

?? Dec 2014 : Became interested in how radar/ultrasonic beamforming is done.

18 Jan 2015 : First version 1.0 written and released to a handful of people via Dropbox.

03 Aug 2016 : Version 1.1 moved the array closer to centre of rendered area.

15 Aug 2016 : Version 1.1 put under revision control and released on GitHub.

The rest, as they say, is git log history.
